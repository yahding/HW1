Hello world! This is Yahong Ding
This is my first time to build up a website through github. It's a very interesting class and software since I have not done this before. 
Through this homework, I can learn the basic ideas of this web builder. 
This class is very nice since the professor, Mike, gave us the assignment with very specific steps. No confusing at all.
